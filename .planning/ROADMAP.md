# Roadmap: v1.1 Publish & Polish

**Milestone:** v1.1
**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-06

## Overview

This milestone takes the shipped v1.0 MVP from development to production. The widget gets published to npm, the app gets deployed to Vercel, and it's registered in the Shopify Partner Dashboard so merchants can install it via direct link. Final phase verifies the complete flow in production.

## Phases

### Phase 07: Publish Widget to npm

**Goal:** Publish `@pricing-matrix/widget` to the npm registry so developers can install it
**Depends on:** None (widget code complete from v1.0)
**Plans:** 2 plans

**Requirements:**
- PUBLISH-01: Widget published to npm with README, types, peer dependencies
- PUBLISH-02: Semver versioning, build artifacts verified

**Success Criteria:**
1. `npm install @pricing-matrix/widget` works from any project
2. Package includes TypeScript types, ESM build, and README with usage examples
3. Widget renders correctly when imported from the published package

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Prepare package metadata, README, LICENSE, and verify build
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Authenticate with npm and publish @gjrkdk/pricing-matrix-widget

### Phase 10: E2E Production Verification

**Goal:** Verify the complete flow works in production from install to Draft Order
**Depends on:** Phases 07, 08, 09 (all prior work complete)
**Plans:** TBD

**Requirements:**
- VERIFY-01: Full end-to-end flow in production
