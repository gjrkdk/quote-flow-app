# Project State: Shopify Price Matrix App

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Phase 2 In Progress — Matrix List & Creation Complete

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Merchants can offer custom-dimension pricing on their headless Shopify storefronts without building their own pricing infrastructure

**What This Is:** A public Shopify app with three components: (1) embedded admin dashboard for matrix configuration, (2) REST API for headless storefronts to fetch pricing, (3) drop-in React widget for easy integration. Merchants define breakpoint grids (width x height), assign them to products, and customers get real-time dimension-based pricing with checkout via Draft Orders.

**Current Focus:** Phase 2 started. Database schema for matrices complete. Settings page with unit preference functional.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 2 of 6 (Admin Matrix Management) — IN PROGRESS
**Plan:** 2 of 6
**Status:** In progress
**Last activity:** 2026-02-04 - Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Matrix List & Creation)

**Progress Bar:**
```

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

**Made:**
- Roadmap structure: 6 phases following dependency chain (Foundation → Admin → Orders → API → Widget → Polish)
- Success criteria defined with observable user behaviors (not implementation tasks)
- Research flags set for Phase 3 (Draft Orders) and Phase 4 (REST API security)
- **[01-01]** PostgreSQL session storage: Use @shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-postgresql instead of Prisma storage
- **[01-01]** Session token strategy: Enable unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy for session token support (third-party cookie fix)
- **[01-01]** GDPR audit trail: Store all GDPR requests in GdprRequest model for compliance audit
- **[01-01]** Connection pooling: Use pg Pool adapter with connection limit for Vercel serverless
- **[01-01]** OAuth scopes: write_products, read_customers, write_draft_orders
- **[01-02]** Single API key per store: Simplest approach for v1, matches most Shopify apps
- **[01-02]** One-time API key viewing: Security best practice (show full key only on generation)
- **[01-02]** Manual welcome card dismissal: Merchants control when to dismiss (per CONTEXT.md)
- **[01-02]** pm_ API key prefix: Industry convention for easy identification
- **[01-03]** Polaris-styled error boundaries in both root.tsx and app.tsx for consistent UX
- **[02-01]** Position-based cell references: Use widthPosition/heightPosition integers instead of value-based references for simpler grid logic
- **[02-01]** Cascade deletes: Configure ON DELETE CASCADE for all matrix relations (automatic cleanup)
- **[02-01]** One matrix per product: Unique constraint on ProductMatrix.productId enforces MATRIX-06 requirement
- **[02-01]** Auto-save unit preference: Immediate save on change using useFetcher pattern (no separate button)
- **[02-02]** Template breakpoints in mm with cm conversion: Small (3x3: 300/600/900mm), Medium (5x5: 200/400/600/800/1000mm), Custom (empty)
- **[02-02]** Matrix duplicate behavior: Copy name with "(copy)" suffix, copy all breakpoints and cells, do NOT copy product assignments
- **[02-02]** Matrix initialization pattern: Transaction creates matrix + breakpoints + zero-value cells atomically

**Pending:**
- Matrix size limits (100x100 from research) - validated during Phase 2 plan 02-03
- Rate limiting strategy (in-memory vs Redis) - decided during Phase 4 planning
- Pricing model (subscription vs one-time) - decided during Phase 6

### Open Todos

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Execute 02-03-PLAN.md (Matrix editor)

**Upcoming:**
- [ ] Research Draft Orders behavior during Phase 3 planning
- [ ] Research API security patterns (HMAC, rate limiting) during Phase 4 planning

### Known Blockers

(None)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

From research:
1. Third-party cookies for embedded sessions - use session tokens
2. Prisma connection exhaustion on Vercel - configure pooling from start
3. Missing GDPR webhooks - register in Phase 1 ✓
4. Draft Orders rate limits - implement retry logic in Phase 3
5. API without HMAC verification - design into Phase 4 from start

### Lessons Learned

- **[01-UAT]** Polaris CSS must be explicitly imported via `links` export — AppProvider alone doesn't load styles
- **[01-UAT]** Root ErrorBoundary needs its own Polaris CSS import since it renders outside the app layout

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-04
**Stopped at:** Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Matrix List & Creation)
**Resume file:** None

**What Just Happened:**
- Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Matrix list page and creation flow)
- Added Matrices navigation link to sidebar between Dashboard and Settings
- Built matrix list page with EmptyState (zero matrices) and IndexTable (populated)
- Built matrix creation page with name input and template selection (3x3, 5x5, custom)
- Implemented delete action with confirmation modal and cascade delete
- Implemented duplicate action copying matrix, breakpoints, and cells
- All TypeScript compilation checks passed

**What Comes Next:**
- Phase 2 Plan 03: Matrix Editor — build the grid editor to modify breakpoints and cell prices
- Matrix list and creation flow complete and functional
- Template initialization creates breakpoints and zero-value cells ready for editing
- Navigation flow established: list → create → redirect to editor

**Context for Next Agent:**
- Matrix list page at /app/matrices shows EmptyState or IndexTable
- Matrix creation at /app/matrices/new creates matrix with templates
- Template breakpoints: Small (3x3), Medium (5x5), Custom (empty)
- Position-based cells (widthPosition/heightPosition) ready for grid display
- Delete and duplicate actions functional
- Ready for matrix editor implementation in plan 02-03
