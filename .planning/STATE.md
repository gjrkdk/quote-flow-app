## Accumulated Context

### Production Environment
- App: https://quote-flow-one.vercel.app (Vercel fra1 + Neon EU Central)
- Widget: quote-flow@0.1.0 on npm
- Codebase: 7,173 LOC TypeScript

### Technical Decisions for v1.2
- Reusable option groups with price modifiers (flexible add-on pricing)
- Percentage modifiers from base price, non-compounding (predictable calculations)
- Integer (cents) arithmetic for all price calculations (avoid floating-point errors)
- GraphQL Admin API migration mandatory (REST deprecated for App Store)
- DIRECT_URL environment variable added to .env for local development (Phase 11: required by Prisma for schema validation)
- Replace strategy for option group choice updates (delete all, create new - simpler than diffing)
- Application-level cap enforcement for option group assignments (5 groups per product in service layer)
- Ceiling rounding for percentage modifiers (Math.ceil toward positive infinity)
- Non-compounding modifier stacking (all calculate from base price)
- Follow exact IndexTable pattern from matrices list page for option groups list (Phase 12-01: consistency in admin UI)
- Show 'Required/Optional' as Type column in option groups list (Phase 12-01: clarity)
- Display product usage warning in delete modal for option groups (Phase 12-01: merchant awareness of impact)
- JSON serialization for nested form data in option group forms (Phase 12-02: handle complex choice arrays)
- Context-specific help text for modifier values based on type (Phase 12-02: user guidance for FIXED vs PERCENTAGE)

### Known Technical Debt
- Billing gates disabled for testing (TODO markers in `billing.server.ts`)
- In-memory rate limiting (Redis migration path documented for multi-instance)
- `use_legacy_install_flow = true` required for proper offline session tokens
- CORS preflight handled before authentication in REST API routes
