# Project State: Shopify Price Matrix App

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Phase 3 In Progress — Database Schema Complete

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Merchants can offer custom-dimension pricing on their headless Shopify storefronts without building their own pricing infrastructure

**What This Is:** A public Shopify app with three components: (1) embedded admin dashboard for matrix configuration, (2) REST API for headless storefronts to fetch pricing, (3) drop-in React widget for easy integration. Merchants define breakpoint grids (width x height), assign them to products, and customers get real-time dimension-based pricing with checkout via Draft Orders.

**Current Focus:** Phase 3 (Draft Orders Integration) in progress. Database schema for order tracking complete. Ready to build draft order creation API.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 3 of 6 (Draft Orders Integration) — IN PROGRESS
**Plan:** 1 of 1 (database schema complete)
**Status:** In progress
**Last activity:** 2026-02-05 - Completed 03-02-PLAN.md (database schema)

**Progress Bar:**

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

**Made:**
- Roadmap structure: 6 phases following dependency chain (Foundation → Admin → Orders → API → Widget → Polish)
- Success criteria defined with observable user behaviors (not implementation tasks)
- Research flags set for Phase 3 (Draft Orders) and Phase 4 (REST API security)
- **[01-01]** PostgreSQL session storage: Use @shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-postgresql instead of Prisma storage
- **[01-01]** Session token strategy: Enable unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy for session token support (third-party cookie fix)
- **[01-01]** GDPR audit trail: Store all GDPR requests in GdprRequest model for compliance audit
- **[01-01]** Connection pooling: Use pg Pool adapter with connection limit for Vercel serverless
- **[01-01]** OAuth scopes: write_products, read_customers, write_draft_orders
- **[01-02]** Single API key per store: Simplest approach for v1, matches most Shopify apps
- **[01-02]** One-time API key viewing: Security best practice (show full key only on generation)
- **[01-02]** Manual welcome card dismissal: Merchants control when to dismiss (per CONTEXT.md)
- **[01-02]** pm_ API key prefix: Industry convention for easy identification
- **[01-03]** Polaris-styled error boundaries in both root.tsx and app.tsx for consistent UX
- **[02-01]** Position-based cell references: Use widthPosition/heightPosition integers instead of value-based references for simpler grid logic
- **[02-01]** Cascade deletes: Configure ON DELETE CASCADE for all matrix relations (automatic cleanup)
- **[02-01]** One matrix per product: Unique constraint on ProductMatrix.productId enforces MATRIX-06 requirement
- **[02-01]** Auto-save unit preference: Immediate save on change using useFetcher pattern (no separate button)
- **[02-02]** Template breakpoints in mm with cm conversion: Small (3x3: 300/600/900mm), Medium (5x5: 200/400/600/800/1000mm), Custom (empty)
- **[02-02]** Matrix duplicate behavior: Copy name with "(copy)" suffix, copy all breakpoints and cells, do NOT copy product assignments
- **[02-02]** Matrix initialization pattern: Transaction creates matrix + breakpoints + zero-value cells atomically
- **[02-03]** Custom HTML table over Polaris DataGrid: Needed full control for spreadsheet-like behavior with inline editing, tab navigation, and dynamic breakpoint headers
- **[02-03]** Map with string keys for cells: Using Map<string, number> with 'col,row' keys provides O(1) cell lookups and natural fit for sparse 2D data
- **[02-03]** Cell re-indexing on breakpoint changes: When breakpoints added/removed in middle of array, all cells re-indexed to maintain position consistency with sorted breakpoints
- **[02-03]** Client-side empty cell validation: Highlights empty cells with red background before save, provides clear visual feedback for required fields
- **[02-04]** Product assignments persist immediately (not part of matrix save flow): Separate actions for assign/remove provide instant feedback without coupling to matrix save
- **[02-04]** GID format normalization: Resource Picker returns various GID formats, always normalize to gid://shopify/Product/{id} for consistency
- **[02-04]** Conflict modal pattern: Two-submit pattern (detect conflicts on first submit, show modal, confirm on second submit) prevents accidental reassignments
- **[03-02]** Store totalDraftOrdersCreated counter for efficient dashboard display without counting records
- **[03-02]** Manual migration creation using prisma migrate diff to handle non-interactive environment

**Pending:**
- Rate limiting strategy (in-memory vs Redis) - decided during Phase 4 planning
- Pricing model (subscription vs one-time) - decided during Phase 6

### Open Todos

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Continue Phase 3 (Draft Orders Integration) - execute remaining plans

**Upcoming:**
- [ ] Research API security patterns (HMAC, rate limiting) during Phase 4 planning

### Known Blockers

(None)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

From research:
1. Third-party cookies for embedded sessions - use session tokens
2. Prisma connection exhaustion on Vercel - configure pooling from start
3. Missing GDPR webhooks - register in Phase 1 ✓
4. Draft Orders rate limits - implement retry logic in Phase 3
5. API without HMAC verification - design into Phase 4 from start

### Lessons Learned

- **[01-UAT]** Polaris CSS must be explicitly imported via `links` export — AppProvider alone doesn't load styles
- **[01-UAT]** Root ErrorBoundary needs its own Polaris CSS import since it renders outside the app layout
- **[02-UAT]** In embedded Shopify apps with `unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy`, never use Polaris `url` props for navigation. Always use Remix's `useNavigate` for client-side navigation to preserve session token context.
- **[02-UAT]** Never call `navigate()` during render. Use `useEffect` or server-side `redirect()`.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-05
**Stopped at:** Completed 03-02-PLAN.md (database schema for order tracking)
**Resume file:** None

**What Just Happened:**
- Executed plan 03-02: Database schema for Draft Order tracking
- Added DraftOrderRecord model with 13 tracking fields (IDs, dimensions, pricing)
- Added totalDraftOrdersCreated counter to Store model
- Created and applied migration (manual workflow for non-interactive environment)
- All 2 tasks committed atomically

**What Comes Next:**
- Phase 3 continues with remaining plans (draft order creation API)
- DraftOrderRecord model available via prisma.draftOrderRecord
- Store counter ready for atomic increment
- Ready to build Shopify Draft Order creation flow

**Context for Next Agent:**
- Phase 2 fully verified (matrix CRUD, spreadsheet editor, product assignments)
- Phase 3 database schema complete: DraftOrderRecord table with cascade deletes
- Database: Store, GdprRequest, PriceMatrix, Breakpoint, MatrixCell, ProductMatrix, DraftOrderRecord
- Counter field pattern established: Store.totalDraftOrdersCreated for efficient dashboard
- All navigation uses Remix useNavigate (not Polaris url props) for embedded app compatibility
- Database running on localhost:5400
