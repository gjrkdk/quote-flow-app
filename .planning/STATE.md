## Accumulated Context

### Production Environment
- App: https://quote-flow-one.vercel.app (Vercel fra1 + Neon EU Central)
- Widget: quote-flow@0.1.0 on npm
- Codebase: 7,173 LOC TypeScript

### Technical Decisions for v1.2
- Reusable option groups with price modifiers (flexible add-on pricing)
- Percentage modifiers from base price, non-compounding (predictable calculations)
- Integer (cents) arithmetic for all price calculations (avoid floating-point errors)
- GraphQL Admin API migration mandatory (REST deprecated for App Store)
- DIRECT_URL environment variable added to .env for local development (Phase 11: required by Prisma for schema validation)
- Replace strategy for option group choice updates (delete all, create new - simpler than diffing)
- Application-level cap enforcement for option group assignments (5 groups per product in service layer)
- Ceiling rounding for percentage modifiers (Math.ceil toward positive infinity)
- Non-compounding modifier stacking (all calculate from base price)
- Follow exact IndexTable pattern from matrices list page for option groups list (Phase 12-01: consistency in admin UI)
- Show 'Required/Optional' as Type column in option groups list (Phase 12-01: clarity)
- Display product usage warning in delete modal for option groups (Phase 12-01: merchant awareness of impact)
- JSON serialization for nested form data in option group forms (Phase 12-02: handle complex choice arrays)
- Context-specific help text for modifier values based on type (Phase 12-02: user guidance for FIXED vs PERCENTAGE)
- Separate fetcher instances for independent form actions on same page (Phase 12-03: prevent action conflicts)
- Loader-level aggregation for product option group counts (Phase 12-03: avoid N+1 queries in assignment UI)
- "At limit" badge for products with 5 option groups assigned (Phase 12-03: visual cap enforcement)
- Store option selections as JSON in DraftOrderRecord rather than normalized relations (Phase 13-02: simpler schema, point-in-time snapshot)
- Transform option IDs to names/labels for Shopify custom attributes (Phase 13-02: human-readable for merchants)
- Include basePrice and optionModifiers in response only when options provided (Phase 13-02: backward compatibility)
- Return empty array (not 404) for products without option groups (Phase 14-01: widget should handle empty state gracefully)
- Place all option types in internal section of widget types file (Phase 14-01: not exported to consumers)
- Extend PriceApiResponse and DraftOrderApiResponse with optional fields (Phase 14-01: backward compatible)
- Use native HTML select for option groups (Phase 14-02: better accessibility and mobile support than custom dropdown)
- No debouncing for option selection changes (Phase 14-02: immediate price refetch unlike debounced dimensions)
- Pre-select default choices for REQUIRED groups on mount (Phase 14-03: improves UX, ensures valid initial state)
- Pass undefined (not empty array) when no selections (Phase 14-03: cleaner API semantics)
- Math.round for dollar-to-cents conversion (Phase 14-04: handles floating-point precision when multiplying by 100)
- Convert all API response price fields to dollars (Phase 14-04: ensures consistent dollar amounts in basePrice and appliedAmount fields)
- Database-backed job queue with exponential backoff (Phase 15-01: simpler than external queue service for MVP)
- Acknowledgment-only for customer_redact (Phase 15-01: app stores no customer PII)
- Enqueue async jobs for GDPR webhooks (Phase 15-02: 200ms response time vs synchronous deletion)
- Vercel Cron with 10 jobs per invocation (Phase 15-02: 600 jobs/hour capacity)

### Known Technical Debt
- Billing gates disabled for testing (TODO markers in `billing.server.ts`)
- In-memory rate limiting (Redis migration path documented for multi-instance)
- `use_legacy_install_flow = true` required for proper offline session tokens
- CORS preflight handled before authentication in REST API routes
